\usage{
s_vif_auto(
  training.df,
  select.cols = NULL,
  omit.cols = c("x", "y", "presence"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{training.df}{A training data frame. Non-numeric columns are excluded from the analysis.}

\item{select.cols}{Character vector, names of the columns which VIF wants to be assessed. If \code{NULL}, all numeric variables but \code{presence.column} are considered. It is recommended to use the variable order of the \code{variable} column from the data frame output of \code{\link{s_biserial_cor}}.}

\item{omit.cols}{Character vector, variables to exclude from the analysis. Defaults to \code{c("x", "y", "presence")}.}

\item{preference.order}{Character vector, column names of \code{training.df} in an order of selection priority desired by the user. For example, if \code{preference.order = c("bio1", "bio2", "bio3")}, the algorithm will first compute vif for all variables in \code{training.df} not included in \code{preference.order}, and remove on each step the variable with a higher vif. Then, vif is computed iteratively on the variables in \code{preference.order}, but removing always the variable with the lowest priority (instead of the variable with the higher vif). Finally, all variables resulting from both vif analyses are grouped together, and a new vif analysis is performed, removing first the variables not in \code{preference.order}. In summary, this option will try to preserve a set of variables as long as their vif values allow it. This option is incompatible with the argument \code{biserial.cor} (see below).}

\item{biserial.cor}{List, output of the function \code{\link{s_biserial_cor}}. Its R-squared scores are used to select variables. In fact, the column "variable" of the data frame within \code{biserial.cor} is used as input for the argument \code{preference.order} explained above. This is just a convenient way to set the priority in variable selection according to the output of \code{s_biserial_cor}.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean, defaults to TRUE. Triggers messages describing what variables are being removed.}
}
\value{
A character vector with the names of the selected variables.
}
\description{
Selects variables within a dataframe that are not correlated with each other, or with linear combinations of other variables, by using the variance inflation factor (VIF) criteria implemented in the \code{\link[HH]{vif}} function (Heilberger and Holland 2004).

\examples{
\dontrun{
data("virtualSpeciesPB")

selected.vars <- s_vif_auto(
 training.df = virtualSpeciesPB,
 select.cols = c("bio5", "bio6", "bio1", "bio12"),
 verbose = TRUE
)
selected.vars

#s_vif_auto() can also take the output of SDMworkshop::s_biserial_cor
#as biserial.cor argument, as follows:
data(virtualSpeciesPB)

biserial.cor.output <- SDMworkshop::s_biserial_cor(
training.df = virtualSpeciesPB,
response.col = "presence",
select.cols = c("bio1", "bio5", "bio6")
)

#using the output of s_biserial_cor() to prioritize variable selection
selected.vars <- SDMworkshop::s_vif_auto(
 training.df = df,
 biserial.cor = biserial.cor.output,
 verbose = TRUE
)
selected.vars
